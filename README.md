A basic ``HTTP/1.1`` server implemented in ``Go`` using the standard net package. 
This project is intended purely for learning and serves as a great introduction to Go programming!

I might update this project furthermore in my journey
## TODO:
- HTTP/2 Support
- PHP-FPM ``Over FastCGI``
- Modularity/Optimizations
- Better error handling
- Better logging
