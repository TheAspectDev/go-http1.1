A basic ``HTTP/1.1`` server implemented in ``Go`` using the standard net package. 
This project is intended purely for learning and serves as a great introduction to Go programming!

I may update this project further as I continue my journey

## TODO:
- HTTP/2 Support
- PHP-FPM ``Over FastCGI``
- Improved Modularity/Optimizations
- Better error handling
- Enhanced logging
